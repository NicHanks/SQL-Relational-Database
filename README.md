# Overview
This code utilizes database management methods through a python extension called SQLite3 to manipulate data stored in a database. It can create a data table that is modifiable and able to execute commands such as, insert, delete, and retrieve(or query) data. It can also submit commands as well as receive them. 

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.} *

The purpose of this software is to utilize the SQLite3 module. 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how you created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

The database I am using is sqlite3 which is a relational database that organizes data into tables and relates them together using keys and is structured in such a way that is easily accesible. 

# Development Environment

Tools used are VS code, python, and the sqlite3 library.

# Future Work

- Add additional table for tax information to join to the employee table.
- Make a software video demo for the project. 
- Finish overview of the project. 

# Addition Ideas/Concepts
- I might use two aggregate functions to summarize numerical data in the database.
- Use a column containing a date or time along with a query that demonstrates filtering within a date or time range.
