# Overview

This code utilizes database management methods through a python extension called SQLite3 to manipulate data stored in a database. It can create a data table that is modifiable and able to execute commands such as, insert, delete, and retrieve(or query) data. It can also submit commands as well as receive them. 

This program can be used by adding employees with their name, phone #, and other information.
The purpose of this software is to utilize the SQLite3 module.

# Relational Database & Development Environment

The database I am using is sqlite3 which is a relational database that organizes data into tables and relates them together using keys and is structured in such a way that is easily accesible. 

Tools used are VS code, python, and the sqlite3 library.

# Future Work

- Add additional table for tax information to join to the employee table.
- Make a software video demo for the project. 
- Finish overview of the project. 

# Addition Ideas/Concepts
- I might use two aggregate functions to summarize numerical data in the database.
- Use a column containing a date or time along with a query that demonstrates filtering within a date or time range.
