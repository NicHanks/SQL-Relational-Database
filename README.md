# Overview
This code utilizes database management methods through a python extension called SQLite3 to manipulate data stored in a database. It can create a data table that is modifiable and able to execute commands such as, insert, delete, and retrieve(or query) data. It can also submit commands as well as receive them. 

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.} *

The purpose of this software is to utilize the SQLite3 module. 
{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

# Future Work

- Add additional tables to your database and perform a join in your software between two of the tables.
- Use at least two of the aggregate functions to summarize numerical data in your database.
- Demonstrate the use of a column containing a date or time along with a query that demonstrates filtering within a date or time range.
